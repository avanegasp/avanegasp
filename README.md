### About me ü§ô

With over 6 years of experience in the technology industry, I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of roles, from **Customer Service to Head of Admissions**. Throughout my career, I've developed strong skills in customer relationship management, data analysis, and Full Stack programming training.

My passion for technology and the desire to tackle complex problems have led me to embark on an exciting transition into the field of **data science**. During my time as a Training Analyst, I had the opportunity to work with data and discover how it can drive strategic decision-making.

I'm committed to continuous learning and am currently acquiring skills in **Python programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning** through courses and personal projects. My prior experience in customer interactions has provided me with valuable insights into how data can be used to better understand user needs and preferences.

### **My Data projects ‚ú® :**

- [United States Fortune 500 Companies](https://github.com/avanegasp/unicatalu-a/blob/gh-pages/Practica_individual_Ucatalu%C3%B1a.ipynb) 
  Study on the dataset that contains the first 500 companies that have made profits and that appear in      Fortune magazine each year. This study can help and give confidence to future investors.
  
- [S&P 500 Enviroment, Social and Goverment (ESG) Risk Ratings](https://github.com/avanegasp/DOS_Modulo_4_PRAI_ESG/blob/main/M%C3%B3dulo4_Practica_individual_ESG_github.ipynb)
  This study shows exclusively samples companies in the S&P 500 index. Researchers, investors, analysts,    and policymakers can use this data set to gain insight into the ESG performance and risk profiles of      these large corporations. Whether exploring trends, conducting ESG assessments, or making informed        investment decisions, this data set serves as a valuable resource for understanding the sustainability    and governance practices of S&P 500 companies.

- [Machine Learning - S&P 500 Enviroment, Social and Goverment (ESG) Risk Ratings](https://github.com/avanegasp/Entrega_Modulo_5/blob/main/5_Modulo_PRAI.ipynb)  
  Complement the previous work by implementing Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning) with the          implementation of different techniques used in machine learning and statistics for data modeling and      prediction.
