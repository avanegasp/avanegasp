# Hi, I¬¥m Angie Vanegas üöÄ

### About me ü§ô

With over 6 years of experience in the technology industry, I've navigated various roles, from Customer Service to Head of Admissions. Throughout my career, I've honed strong skills in customer relationship management, data analysis, and Full Stack programming training.

Driven by a passion for technology and a knack for solving intricate challenges, I'm now transitioning into the realm of **backend development**. As a Training Analyst, I delved into data-driven insights that shape strategic decisions, sparking my interest in data science.

I'm dedicated to ongoing growth, presently expanding my expertise in Python programming, statistical analysis, and machine learning through coursework and personal projects. My background in customer interactions offers a unique perspective on leveraging data to enhance user understanding and satisfaction.
